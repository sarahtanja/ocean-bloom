# ROUND OVERVIEW

Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, take 1 of the following 4 actions for 5 turns each:

1. Play One Phytoplankton
> Select 1 phytoplankton card from your hand to play
> Select the Ocean Region where you want to play the card, you must play in the leftmost slot of the Ocean Region
> Discard the number of carbon (red jellybeans) from phytoplankton cards equal to the number of carbon shown in the column where you want to play your phytoplankton card (only applies to columns 2 & 3)
> Discard the resource cost shown on the card. You may spend any 2 resources to use as 1 resource
> If the phytoplankton has a 'when played' power, activate if for that card only

2. Gain Resources (Coastal region)

yellow jellybeans - light
purple jellybeans - phosphorus
green jellybeans - nitrogen
orange jellybeans - iron
pink jellybeans - silica

> Gain a number of resources (jellybeans) equal to the number of resource die exposed in your leftmost Coastal region by removing resource die from the box and gaining the matching jellybeans (N/Si means you can take either one)
> Activate any green Coastal region powers you wish, right to left

3. Grow (Open Ocean)
> Gain a number of carbon (red jellybeans) equal to the number of carbon icons exposed in your leftmost Open Ocean region and place them on your phytoplankton card
> Activate any green Open Ocean region powers you wish, right to left

4. Draw Cards (Polar Ocean)
> Draw phytoplankton cards equal to the number of card icons exposed in your leftmost Polar Ocean region
> Draw cards either from the three face-up cards in the middle of the play area, or draw blindly from the card stack. If you draw from the face-up cards, replace what you took from the card stack.
> Activate any green Polar Ocean region powers you wish, right to left

# MANAGING THE RESOURCE DICE
> If the resource box is ever empty, re-roll all resource dice back in
> If the dice in the box all show the same face (including if there is only 1 die) and you are about to gain resources for any reason, you may first throw all 5 dice back into the resource box (N/Si counts as a unique face)

# END OF THE ROUND
1. Once each player has taken 5 turns, replenish the face-up phytoplankton cards in the center and rotate the first player clockwise. Play for a total of 3 rounds!

# END OF THE GAME

1. Points listed on each phytoplankton card
2. Points listed on a completed special mission card
3. 1 point per:
>carbon on phytoplankton cards
>resource cahced on phytoplankton cards
>card tucked behind another card

The player with the most points wins. If tied, whoever has the most carbon wins. If still tied, victory is shared.
