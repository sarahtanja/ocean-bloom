"Ocean Bloom" is a fun and educational boardgame that can be used to teach a broad audience about phytoplankton. Players take on the role of a scientist conducting a research cruise in the world's oceans to uncover phytoplankton's diverse abilities to sequester carbon, produce oxygen, and sometimes form harmful algal blooms. 

The game was produced by Kaitlin Harrison, Rachel Liu, and Sarah Tanja as part of University of Washington's OCEAN 531 A Winter Quarter Phytoplankton and Biogeochemistry Seminar taught by Dr. Jodi Young.

This game is modeled after the award-winning boardgame "Wingspan" Designed by Elizabeth Hargrave and illustrated by Natalia Rojas, Ana Maria Martinez Jaramillo, and Beth Sobel (https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/). Elements of the game also reflect the educational card-game "Phytoplankton Flash" (https://akffa.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/phytoplankton-fash-cards.pdf) funded by a grant to Dr. Vera Trainer at NOAAâ€™s NFSC (www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/hab), in which Dr. Rita Horner (University of Washington) and Sheryl Day (NOAA) designed cards; Kathleen K. Newell (University of Washington), Brian Bill (NOAA) supplied the phytoplankton photographs, and Catie Bursch provided illustrations.
